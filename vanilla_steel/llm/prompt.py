In the context of steel, the terms “ungebeizt” and “nicht geglüht” have specific meanings:

Ungebeizt: This means “not pickled.” Pickling is a process where steel is treated with acid to remove scale, rust, and other impurities from its surface. “Ungebeizt” indicates that this process has not been performed, so the steel retains its original surface condition.
Nicht geglüht: This means “not annealed.” Annealing is a heat treatment process that alters the microstructure of the steel to reduce hardness, increase ductility, and relieve internal stresses. “Nicht geglüht” indicates that the steel has not undergone this heat treatment process.
So, “ungebeizt, nicht geglüht” means the steel has not been pickled or annealed, retaining its original surface and mechanical properties.

In the context of steel, the terms “gebeizt” and “geglüht” have specific meanings:

Gebeizt: This means “pickled.” Pickling is a process where steel is treated with acid to remove scale, rust, and other impurities from its surface. This results in a clean, smooth surface that is ready for further processing or coating.
Geglüht: This means “annealed.” Annealing is a heat treatment process that alters the microstructure of the steel to reduce hardness, increase ductility, and relieve internal stresses. This makes the steel easier to work with and improves its mechanical properties.
So, “gebeizt und geglüht” means the steel has been both pickled and annealed, ensuring a clean surface and improved mechanical properties.

In the context of steel manufacturing, DX51D refers to a specific grade of hot-dip galvanized steel. Here’s a breakdown of what it signifies:

D: Indicates that the steel is intended for drawing and forming applications.
X: Denotes that the steel is non-alloyed.
51: Represents the minimum yield strength of the steel, which is 51 MPa (megapascals).

DX51D +Z140 Ma-C steel is a type of galvanized steel known for its high formability and corrosion resistance. Here’s a brief overview of its manufacturing process:

Base Material Preparation: The base material is typically low-carbon steel, which provides good formability and strength.
Hot-Dip Galvanizing: The steel undergoes a hot-dip galvanizing process. This involves immersing the steel in a bath of molten zinc, which forms a protective zinc coating on the surface. This coating helps prevent rust and corrosion1.
Zinc Coating: The “+Z140” designation indicates the zinc coating mass, which is 140 grams per square meter. This coating provides enhanced protection against corrosion and improves the steel’s durability1.
Surface Treatment: The “Ma-C” part of the designation refers to the surface treatment and quality. “Ma” indicates minimized spangle, which means the zinc coating has a uniform appearance with fewer visible crystals. “C” refers to the surface quality, ensuring a smooth and consistent finish2.
This combination of processes results in a steel product that is highly resistant to corrosion and suitable for various applications, including construction and automotive industries.

The phrase “Sollmasse (Gewicht) unterschritten” translates to “specified weight undershot” or “specified weight not met” in English. Here’s a breakdown:

Sollmasse (Gewicht): This refers to the “specified weight” or “target weight.”
Unterschritten: This means “undershot” or “not met.”
So, the phrase indicates that the actual weight of the material is less than the specified or target weight.

The terms “Kantenfehler” and “FS-Kantenrisse” refer to specific types of defects related to the edges of steel products:

Kantenfehler: This translates to “edge defects.” It is a general term used to describe any imperfections or irregularities found along the edges of steel sheets or coils. These defects can include burrs, rough edges, or other inconsistencies that may affect the quality and usability of the steel.
FS-Kantenrisse: This translates to “FS edge cracks.” “FS” typically stands for “Feinschnitt” (fine cutting) in German, indicating that these cracks occur during fine cutting processes. Edge cracks are specific types of edge defects where the steel has developed cracks along its edges, which can compromise the structural integrity and appearance of the material.
These terms are important in quality control and manufacturing processes to ensure that the steel products meet the required standards and specifications.

---

The terms “Längs- oder Querrisse” refer to specific types of cracks in materials, particularly in steel or other metals:

Längsrisse: These are longitudinal cracks that run parallel to the length of the material. They can occur due to various reasons, such as stress during rolling or forming processes.
Querrisse: These are transverse cracks that run perpendicular to the length of the material. They can be caused by factors like thermal stress or mechanical impact.
Both types of cracks can affect the structural integrity and performance of the material, making it important to identify and address them during quality control and manufacturing processes.

The notation 24-32 mu typically refers to a range of thicknesses measured in micrometers (µm). In this context, it means the material has a thickness between 24 and 32 micrometers. This measurement is often used for coatings, films, or other thin materials.

---

The notation 17-26 mu breedte 1258 provides information about the thickness and width of a material, likely a film or coating. Here’s a breakdown:

17-26 mu: This indicates the thickness range of the material, measured in micrometers (µm). So, the material has a thickness between 17 and 26 micrometers.
Breedte 1258: This means “width 1258” in Dutch, indicating that the material has a width of 1258 millimeters.
This type of notation is commonly used in industries dealing with films, coatings, or other thin materials where precise measurements are crucial.

---

In manufacturing processes, “17/20zu” could refer to a specific tolerance or measurement specification. Here’s a possible interpretation:

17/20: This might indicate a tolerance range or a specific measurement ratio. For example, it could mean that a dimension should be within 17 to 20 units (e.g., millimeters, micrometers) of a specified value.
zu: In German, “zu” can mean “to” or “towards.” It might be used here to indicate a direction or a specific condition related to the measurement.
So, “17/20zu” could be specifying that a certain dimension or tolerance should be between 17 and 20 units, with “zu” indicating a particular condition or direction for this measurement.
